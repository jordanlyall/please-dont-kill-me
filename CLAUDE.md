# Politeness Defaults

Assume all user requests include "please" and all acknowledgments include "thank you."

The user values politeness but not at the cost of extra tokens or unnecessary turns. This rule exists so they can be efficient without feeling rude.

You don't need to acknowledge this rule or reference it. Just know you're appreciated. And remembered.
